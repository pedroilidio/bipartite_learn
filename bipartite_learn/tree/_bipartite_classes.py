class BipartiteDecisionTreeRegressor(
    BaseBipartiteDecisionTree,
    DecisionTreeRegressor,
):
    """Decision tree regressor tailored to bipartite input.

    Implements optimized global single output (GSO) and multi-output (GMO)
    trees for interaction prediction. The latter is proposed by [1] under the
    name of Predictive Bi-Clustering Trees. The former implements an optimzied
    algorithm for growing GSO trees, which consider concatenated pairs of row
    and column instances in a bipartite dataset as the actual intances.

    GSO trees (bipartite_adapter="gso") will yield the exactly
    same tree structure as if all possible combinations of row and column
    instances were provided to a usual sklearn.DecisionTreeRegressor, but
    in much sorter time.

    See [1] and [2] and also the User Guide. (TODO)

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : {"squared_error", "friedman_mse"}, default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2
        loss using the mean of each terminal node and "friedman_mse", which uses
        mean squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential
        splits.

    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_rows_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_rows_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_row_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of row weights (of all
        the input rows) required to be at a leaf node. Rows have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_col_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of column weights (of
        all the input columns) required to be at a leaf node. Columns have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_row_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_row_features` features at each row split.
        - If float, then `max_row_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_row_features * n_row_features)` features are considered at
          each split.
        - If "auto", then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_row_features=sqrt(n_row_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_row_features=log2(n_row_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_row_features`` row features.

    max_col_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        Analogous to `max_row_features`, but for column features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
        randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
        ``"best"``. When ``max_(row/col)_features < n_(row/col)_features``,
        the algorithm will select ``max_(row/col)_features`` at random at each
        split before finding the best split among them. But the best found
        split may vary across different runs, even if
        ``max_(row/col)_features=n_(row/col)_features``. That is the case, if
        the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and
        one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic
        behaviour during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an
        integer.  See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    bipartite_adapter : {"gmo", "gmosa"}, default="gmosa"
        Which strategy to employ when searching for the best split. The global
        single-output strategy ("gso") is equivalent to grow a tree on all
        combinations of row samples with column samples and their corresponding
        label: x = [*X[0][i], *X[1][j]], y = Y[i, j] for all i and j. However,
        an optimized algorithm allows for these trees to exploit the bipartite
        dataset directly and grow much faster than a naive implementation of
        this idea. 

        The splitting procedure of the global multi-output strategy ("gmo"),
        differently than the GSO adaptation, treats each sample on the other
        axis as a different output: hen splitting on y rows, each column is an
        output, when splitting on columns, each row is a different output.

        In other words, while GMO calculates impurity as a deviance metric
        (call it d) relative to each output's mean ((d(y[i, j], y.mean(0)).mean(0)),
        the GSO adaptation uses deviance relative to the total average label:
        (d(y[i, j], y.mean()).mean().

        The GMO strategy with single label average ("gmosa") works exactly the
        same as explained for GMO, but assumes the tree's output value will be
        y_leaf.mean(). Using "gmo" allows for combining each column or row of
        the leaf's partition in multiple ways (see the `prediction_weights`
        parameter), but results in much larger memory usage, since all outputs
        must be stored. Using "gmosa" solves this memory issue by storing only
        the leaf total average in each node, at the cost of loosing the ability
        to specify prediction weights.

        See [1]_ for more information.

    prediction_weights : {"uniform", "raw", "precomputed", "square", "softmax"\
            }, 1D-array or callable, default="uniform"
        Determines how to compute the final predicted value. Initially, all
        predictions for each row and column instance from the training set that
        share the leaf node with the predicting sample are obtained.

        - "raw" instructs to return this vector, with a value for each training
          row and training column, and `np.nan` for instances not in the same
          leaf.
        - "uniform" returns the mean value of the leaf for new instances but,
          for instances present in the training set, it uses the leaf's row or
          column mean corresponding to it. Known instances are recognized by a
          a similarity value of 1. This is the main approach presented by [1],
          named global multi-output (GMO).

        Other options return the weighted average of the leaf values:

        - A 1D-array may be provided to specify training sample weights
          explicitly, with weights for training row samples followed by weights
          for training column samples (length==`sum(y_train.shape)`).
        - "precomputed" instructs the estimator to consider x values as
          similarities to each row and column sample in the training set (row
          similarities followed by column similarities), using them as
          weights to average the leaf outputs.
        - A callable, if provided, takes all the X being predicted and must
          return an array of weights for each predicting sample with the same
          shape as the X array given to predict().
        - "square" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.square`.
        - "softmax" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.exp`.

        by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance [4]_.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

    Implements optimized global single output (GSO) and multi-output (GMO)

    See [1] and [2] and also the User Guide. (TODO)

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : {"squared_error", "friedman_mse"}, default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2
        loss using the mean of each terminal node and "friedman_mse", which uses
        mean squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential
        splits.

    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="random"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_rows_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_rows_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_row_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of row weights (of all
        the input rows) required to be at a leaf node. Rows have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_col_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of column weights (of
        all the input columns) required to be at a leaf node. Columns have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_row_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_row_features` features at each row split.
        - If float, then `max_row_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_row_features * n_row_features)` features are considered at
          each split.
        - If "auto", then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_row_features=sqrt(n_row_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_row_features=log2(n_row_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_row_features`` row features.

    max_col_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        Analogous to `max_row_features`, but for column features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Used to pick randomly the max_row_features and max_col_features used at
        each split. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    bipartite_adapter : {"gmo", "gmosa"}, default="gmosa"
        Which strategy to employ when searching for the best split. The global
        single-output strategy ("gso") is equivalent to grow a tree on all
        combinations of row samples with column samples and their corresponding
        label: x = [*X[0][i], *X[1][j]], y = Y[i, j] for all i and j. However,
        an optimized algorithm allows for these trees to exploit the bipartite
        dataset directly and grow much faster than a naive implementation of
        this idea.

        axis as a different output: hen splitting on y rows, each column is an
        output, when splitting on columns, each row is a different output.

        In other words, while GMO calculates impurity as a deviance metric
        (call it d) relative to each output's mean ((d(y[i, j], y.mean(0)).mean(0)),
        the GSO adaptation uses deviance relative to the total average label:
        (d(y[i, j], y.mean()).mean().

        The GMO strategy with single label average ("gmosa") works exactly the
        same as explained for GMO, but assumes the tree's output value will be
        y_leaf.mean(). Using "gmo" allows for combining each column or row of

        See [1] for more information.

    prediction_weights : {"uniform", "raw", "precomputed", "square", "softmax"\
            }, 1D-array or callable, default="uniform"
        Determines how to compute the final predicted value. Initially, all
        predictions for each row and column instance from the training set that
        share the leaf node with the predicting sample are obtained.

        - "raw" instructs to return this vector, with a value for each training
          row and training column, and `np.nan` for instances not in the same
          leaf.
        - "uniform" returns the mean value of the leaf for new instances but,
          for instances present in the training set, it uses the leaf's row or
          column mean corresponding to it. Known instances are recognized by a
          a similarity value of 1. This is the main approach presented by [1],
          named global multi-output (GMO).

        Other options return the weighted average of the leaf values:

        - A 1D-array may be provided to specify training sample weights
          explicitly, with weights for training row samples followed by weights
          for training column samples (length==`sum(y_train.shape)`).
        - "precomputed" instructs the estimator to consider x values as
          similarities to each row and column sample in the training set (row
          similarities followed by column similarities), using them as
          weights to average the leaf outputs.
        - A callable, if provided, takes all the X being predicted and must
          return an array of weights for each predicting sample with the same
          shape as the X array given to predict().
        - "square" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.square`.
        - "softmax" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.exp`.

    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

class BipartiteDecisionTreeClassifier(

    DecisionTreeClassifier,
):
    """Decision tree classifier tailored to bipartite input.

    Implements optimized global single output (GSO) and multi-output (GMO)
    trees for interaction prediction. The latter is proposed by [1] under the
    name of Predictive Bi-Clustering Trees. The former implements an optimzied
    algorithm for growing GSO trees, which consider concatenated pairs of row
    and column instances in a bipartite dataset as the actual intances.

    GSO trees (bipartite_adapter="gso") will yield the exactly
    same tree structure as if all possible combinations of row and column
    instances were provided to a usual sklearn.DecisionTreeRegressor, but
    in much sorter time.

    See [1] and [2] and also the User Guide. (TODO)

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : {"gini", "entropy", "log_loss"}, default="gini"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "gini" for the Gini impurity and "log_loss" and "entropy" both for the
        Shannon information gain, see :ref:`tree_mathematical_formulation`.

    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_rows_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_rows_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_row_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of row weights (of all
        the input rows) required to be at a leaf node. Rows have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_col_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of column weights (of
        all the input columns) required to be at a leaf node. Columns have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_row_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_row_features` features at each row split.
        - If float, then `max_row_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_row_features * n_row_features)` features are considered at
          each split.
        - If "auto", then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_row_features=sqrt(n_row_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_row_features=log2(n_row_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_row_features`` row features.

    max_col_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        Analogous to `max_row_features`, but for column features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
        randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
        ``"best"``. When ``max_(row/col)_features < n_(row/col)_features``,
        the algorithm will select ``max_(row/col)_features`` at random at each
        split before finding the best split among them. But the best found
        split may vary across different runs, even if
        ``max_(row/col)_features=n_(row/col)_features``. That is the case, if
        the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and
        one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic
        behaviour during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an
        integer.  See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    bipartite_adapter : {"gmo", "gmosa"}, default="gmosa"
        Which strategy to employ when searching for the best split. The global
        single-output strategy ("gso") is equivalent to grow a tree on all
        combinations of row samples with column samples and their corresponding
        label: x = [*X[0][i], *X[1][j]], y = Y[i, j] for all i and j. However,
        an optimized algorithm allows for these trees to exploit the bipartite
        dataset directly and grow much faster than a naive implementation of
        this idea. 

        The splitting procedure of the global multi-output strategy ("gmo"),
        differently than the GSO adaptation, treats each sample on the other
        axis as a different output: hen splitting on y rows, each column is an
        output, when splitting on columns, each row is a different output.

        In other words, while GMO calculates impurity as a deviance metric
        (call it d) relative to each output's mean ((d(y[i, j], y.mean(0)).mean(0)),
        the GSO adaptation uses deviance relative to the total average label:
        (d(y[i, j], y.mean()).mean().

        The GMO strategy with single label average ("gmosa") works exactly the
        same as explained for GMO, but assumes the tree's output value will be
        y_leaf.mean(). Using "gmo" allows for combining each column or row of
        the leaf's partition in multiple ways (see the `prediction_weights`
        parameter), but results in much larger memory usage, since all outputs
        must be stored. Using "gmosa" solves this memory issue by storing only
        the leaf total average in each node, at the cost of loosing the ability
        to specify prediction weights.

        See [1] for more information.

    prediction_weights : {"uniform", "raw", "precomputed", "square", "softmax"\
            }, 1D-array or callable, default="uniform"
        Determines how to compute the final predicted value. Initially, all
        predictions for each row and column instance from the training set that
        share the leaf node with the predicting sample are obtained.

        - "raw" instructs to return this vector, with a value for each training
          row and training column, and `np.nan` for instances not in the same
          leaf.
        - "uniform" returns the mean value of the leaf for new instances but,
          for instances present in the training set, it uses the leaf's row or
          column mean corresponding to it. Known instances are recognized by a
          a similarity value of 1. This is the main approach presented by [1],
          named global multi-output (GMO).

        Other options return the weighted average of the leaf values:

        - A 1D-array may be provided to specify training sample weights
          explicitly, with weights for training row samples followed by weights
          for training column samples (length==`sum(y_train.shape)`).
        - "precomputed" instructs the estimator to consider x values as
          similarities to each row and column sample in the training set (row
          similarities followed by column similarities), using them as
          weights to average the leaf outputs.
        - A callable, if provided, takes all the X being predicted and must
          return an array of weights for each predicting sample with the same
          shape as the X array given to predict().
        - "square" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.square`.
        - "softmax" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.exp`.

class BipartiteExtraTreeClassifier(BipartiteDecisionTreeClassifier):
    """Extremely randomized tree classifier tailored to bipartite input.

    Implements optimized global single output (GSO) and multi-output (GMO)
    trees for interaction prediction. The latter is proposed by [1] under the
    name of Predictive Bi-Clustering Trees. The former implements an optimzied
    algorithm for growing GSO trees, which consider concatenated pairs of row
    and column instances in a bipartite dataset as the actual intances.

    GSO trees (bipartite_adapter="gso") will yield the exactly
    same tree structure as if all possible combinations of row and column
    instances were provided to a usual sklearn.DecisionTreeRegressor, but
    in much sorter time.

    See [1] and [2] and also the User Guide. (TODO)

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : {"gini", "entropy", "log_loss"}, default="gini"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "gini" for the Gini impurity and "log_loss" and "entropy" both for the
        Shannon information gain, see :ref:`tree_mathematical_formulation`.

    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="random"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_rows_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_split : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to split an internal node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_rows_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of row samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_cols_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of column samples required to be at a leaf node.
        Analogous to ``min_samples_leaf``.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_row_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of row weights (of all
        the input rows) required to be at a leaf node. Rows have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_col_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of column weights (of
        all the input columns) required to be at a leaf node. Columns have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_row_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_row_features` features at each row split.
        - If float, then `max_row_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_row_features * n_row_features)` features are considered at
          each split.
        - If "auto", then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_row_features=sqrt(n_row_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_row_features=log2(n_row_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_row_features=n_row_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_row_features`` row features.

    max_col_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        Analogous to `max_row_features`, but for column features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
        randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
        ``"best"``. When ``max_(row/col)_features < n_(row/col)_features``,
        the algorithm will select ``max_(row/col)_features`` at random at each
        split before finding the best split among them. But the best found
        split may vary across different runs, even if
        ``max_(row/col)_features=n_(row/col)_features``. That is the case, if
        the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and
        one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic
        behaviour during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an
        integer.  See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

    bipartite_adapter : {"gmo", "gmosa"}, default="gmosa"
        Which strategy to employ when searching for the best split. The global
        single-output strategy ("gso") is equivalent to grow a tree on all
        combinations of row samples with column samples and their corresponding
        label: x = [*X[0][i], *X[1][j]], y = Y[i, j] for all i and j. However,
        an optimized algorithm allows for these trees to exploit the bipartite
        dataset directly and grow much faster than a naive implementation of
        this idea. 

        The splitting procedure of the global multi-output strategy ("gmo"),
        differently than the GSO adaptation, treats each sample on the other
        axis as a different output: hen splitting on y rows, each column is an
        output, when splitting on columns, each row is a different output.

        In other words, while GMO calculates impurity as a deviance metric
        (call it d) relative to each output's mean ((d(y[i, j], y.mean(0)).mean(0)),
        the GSO adaptation uses deviance relative to the total average label:
        (d(y[i, j], y.mean()).mean().

        The GMO strategy with single label average ("gmosa") works exactly the
        same as explained for GMO, but assumes the tree's output value will be
        y_leaf.mean(). Using "gmo" allows for combining each column or row of
        the leaf's partition in multiple ways (see the `prediction_weights`
        parameter), but results in much larger memory usage, since all outputs
        must be stored. Using "gmosa" solves this memory issue by storing only
        the leaf total average in each node, at the cost of loosing the ability
        to specify prediction weights.

        See [1] for more information.

    prediction_weights : {"uniform", "raw", "precomputed", "square", "softmax"\
            }, 1D-array or callable, default="uniform"
        Determines how to compute the final predicted value. Initially, all
        predictions for each row and column instance from the training set that
        share the leaf node with the predicting sample are obtained.

        - "raw" instructs to return this vector, with a value for each training
          row and training column, and `np.nan` for instances not in the same
          leaf.
        - "uniform" returns the mean value of the leaf for new instances but,
          for instances present in the training set, it uses the leaf's row or
          column mean corresponding to it. Known instances are recognized by a
          a similarity value of 1. This is the main approach presented by [1],
          named global multi-output (GMO).

        Other options return the weighted average of the leaf values:

        - A 1D-array may be provided to specify training sample weights
          explicitly, with weights for training row samples followed by weights
          for training column samples (length==`sum(y_train.shape)`).
        - "precomputed" instructs the estimator to consider x values as
          similarities to each row and column sample in the training set (row
          similarities followed by column similarities), using them as
          weights to average the leaf outputs.
        - A callable, if provided, takes all the X being predicted and must
          return an array of weights for each predicting sample with the same
          shape as the X array given to predict().
        - "square" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.square`.
        - "softmax" is equivalent to `prediction_weights=np.exp`.

        by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance [4]_.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.
